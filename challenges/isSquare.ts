/**
 * @description You like building blocks. 
 * You especially like building blocks that are squares. 
 * And what you even like more, is to arrange them into a square of square building blocks! 
 * However, sometimes, you can't arrange them into a square. 
 * Instead, you end up with an ordinary rectangle! 
 * Those blasted things! 
 * If you just had a way to know, whether you're currently working in vainâ€¦ Wait! 
 * That's it! You just have to check if your number of building blocks is a perfect square.
